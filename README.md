# 🚦 Traffic Volume Analysis & Visualization Using Data Mining Techniques

## 📘 Project Overview
This project investigates traffic volume patterns using the [Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/damianogalassi/traffic-volume?resource=download). It combines data mining techniques with dynamic data visualization to uncover insights from hourly, weather-related, and holiday-based traffic trends.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze traffic trends using temporal and environmental attributes.
- Apply data mining algorithms for pattern recognition and prediction.
- Create meaningful visualizations through Power BI dashboards.
- Derive insights to support transportation and urban planning.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Power BI** – Interactive dashboard development  
- **Weka** – Clustering & Regression analysis  
- **Dataset** – [Kaggle: Metro Interstate Traffic Volume](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/damianogalassi/traffic-volume?resource=download)

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Rush Hour Peaks**: 8:00 AM and 5:00–6:00 PM
- **Weather Effect**: Clear weather = increased traffic; rainy/snowy days = lower volume
- **Holiday Drop**: Public holidays show significant dips in vehicle volume
- **Model Accuracy**:
  - Linear Regression R = 0.39
  - Key influencing features: `hour`, `temp`, `holiday`
